        NASA's Scout Data API provides access to near-realtime results from the Centre for Near Earth
        Object Studies (CNEOS) Sout system. Scout provides trajectory analysis and hazard assessment 
        for recently detected objects on the Minor Planet Centerâ€™s Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page 
        (NEOCP). Objects on these pages are unconfirmed; their designations are user-assigned and unofficial. 
        These objects could be real asteroids, but they cannot be officially designated until they are 
        confirmed by additional observations.
